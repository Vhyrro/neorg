* The `.norg` file-format
  If you find the [spec](https://github.com/vhyrro/neorg/blob/main/docs/NFF-0.1-spec.md)
  too long and want to jump-start your Neorg skills, you've come to the right place!

 ** Basic Markup
    Here is how you can do very basic markup. First you see it raw, then rendered:
    - \*bold\*: *bold*
    - \/italic\/: /italic/
    - \_underline\_: _underline_
    - \-strikethrough\-: -strikethrough-
    - \|spoiler\|: |spoiler|
    - \`inline code\`: `inline code`
    - \^superscript\^: ^superscript^
    - \,subscript\,: ,subscript,

    This also immediately shows you how to escape a special character using the backslash, \\.

 ** Things which you can nest
    Neorg generally does *NOT* care about indentation! ðŸŽ‰
    Thus, nesting is done via repeating modifiers like you are used to it from Markdown headings.
    Note, that this allows you to start at an arbitrary nesting level if you so desire!

  *** Unordered lists
        - Unordered list level 1
        -- Unordered list level 2
        --- Unordered list level 3
        ---- Unordered list level 4
        ----- Unordered list level 5
        ------ Unordered list level 6

  *** Ordered lists
        ~ Ordered list level 1
        ~~ Ordered list level 2
        ~~~ Ordered list level 3
        ~~~~ Ordered list level 4
        ~~~~~ Ordered list level 5
        ~~~~~~ Ordered list level 6

  *** Tasks
        - [ ] Undone Task
        - [*] Pending Task
        - [x] Done Task

        You can also nest tasks:
        -- [ ] Nested task level 2
        --- [ ] Nested task level 3
        ---- [ ] Nested task level 4
        ----- [ ] Nested task level 5
        ------ [ ] Nested task level 6

  *** Quotes
      > 1. level quote
      >> 2. level quote
      >>> 3. level quote
      >>>> 4. level quote
      >>>>> 5. level quote
      >>>>>> 6. level quote

  *** Headings
      You already saw headings up to the third out of six levels. I assume by now you know how they
      work. But now...

   **** ... prepare to have your mind blown!
        Because here is something very special and unique to Neorg:

    ***** Indentation reversion
          As you would expect, this paragraph belongs to the fifth level heading.

      ****** Final heading level
             And this paragraph belongs to the sixth level. But by using the following modifier:
             ---

          We can move this text to the fifth level again! ðŸ¤¯
          ---

        So using 3 or more `-` signs not followed by anything, you move *one* level backwards in the
        indentation.

===

And using 3 or more `=` signs will drop you right back to the root level!

 ** Links
    We borrow the basic link syntax from markdown: `[link text](link source)`
    Here are some example which also show you a special list kind for links:

    -> [arbitrary heading link](#links)
    --> [heading level 1](*The `.norg` file-format)
    -> [some marker](|some marker)
    -> [some drawer](||some drawer)

    These links will be ordered:
    ~> [shameless plug](https://github.com/vhyrro/taurivim)
    ~> [shameless plug](https://github.com/danymat/neogen)

    You can link to objects in other files like so:
    `[link text](:file:#location)`
    `[link text](:file:other_file:#location)`

 ** Markers
    You can mark specific locations in your file with markers:
    | some marker

 ** Drawers
    Drawers are a concept you may know from org-mode. They allow you to hide text:
    || some drawer
    My very important secret... ðŸ¤«
    ||

 ** Data Tags
    Neorg supports a number of tags. The general format is:
    @data possible parameters
    contents
    @end

  *** Carryover
      There is also an infectious carryover variant which allows shorter syntax. Its format is:
      `$data possible parameters`, which will apply the `data` tag *only* to the following
      paragraph.

  *** Comments
      $comment
      This is a comment.
      This is also still a comment because the paragraph has not ended, yet.

      The double line break ended the paragraph so this is no longer part of the comment.

  *** Name
      $name foreplay
      > The foreplay is called that way because it's a preliminary introduction to the document
      > tells the parser how the rest of the document will play out: fore, play.
      > Makes sense, right? - Vhyrro

      This quote now has a /name/!

  *** List ordering
      You can affect ordered lists and specify their /start/, /step/ and /spacing/ values (all of
      them default to 1).

      $ordered 2 2 2
      ~ First entry
      ~ Second entry

      This will render as:
      @code
      2. First entry

      4. Second entry
      @end

  *** Tables
      @table
      Column 1 | Column 2
      -
      This is in a new row | which got separated by a horizontal line
      And check this out: I can span the columns!
      @end

      Tables will become OP in the future!

  *** Code Blocks
      @code
      console.log("But I want syntax highlighting...")
      @end

      @code lua
      console.log("Thank you!")
      @end

  *** Media
      You can embed images directly in base64 format like so:
      @image png svg jpeg jfif exif
      -- base64-encoded image data
      @end
      Obviously you need to pick one of the available formats.

      You can embed external image or video files like so:
      @embed image
      https://github.com/vhyrro/neorg/blob/main/res/neorg.svg
      @end

 ** Advanced markup
    There are some more advanced markup features:

  *** The Link modifier
      If you want to mark-up text which is not surrounded by punctuation or whitespace, you need to
      use the *link* modifier, `:`, like so:

      W:*h*:y w:/oul/:d a:_nyon_:e w:-an-:t to do t:`hi`:s?

  *** Object continuation
      The `~` trailing modifier causes the line break to be ignored. This allows you to do things
      like this:

   **** This is a super duper long heading which I am so proud of and I absolutely cannot shorten~
        to fit onto a single line

  *** Insertions
      These are dynamically expended objects which you can add to your document's
      [foreplay](#foreplay). Continue reading to find out where to find them.

  *** Foreplay
      If you read the quote above, you already heard this before. The /foreplay/ is located at the
      beginning of your document. It can contain ranged tags ([data tags](#data tags) which are not
      written in their [carryover](#carryover) syntax), insertions and an arbitrary number of empty
      lines. Most importantly is the `document.meta` tag which we skipped over previously. You can
      find an example of it at the top of this file.
