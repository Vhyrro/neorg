*** Code Blocks + Superpowers

    The `core.looking-glass` module magnifies code blocks and allows you to edit them in a separate buffer. 

* Overview

  The looking glass module provides a simple way to edit code blocks in an external buffer,
  which allows LSPs and other language-specific tools to kick in. 

  The magnify command can be accessed by running `:Neorg keybind all core.looking-glass.magnify-code-block` with your cursor underneath the code
  block you would like to magnify - it is not bound to any key as of currently,
  but you may map it yourself via the {https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg/wiki/User-Keybinds}[`core.keybinds`] module.
